<h1 class="centered">But what about classes/OOP?</h1>
<p>
  Yes you can. Though that doesn't mean you should!
</p>
<p>
  Anyways:
</p>
<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: js">
<![CDATA[
(function() {
  Cigar = function() {
    this.lit = false;
  }
  Cigar.prototype = {
    lightIt:  function() { this.lit = true },
    puff:     function() { if (!this.lit) this.lightIt() },
    putOut:   function() { this.lit = false }
  };  
})()
var ciggie = new Cigar();
ciggie.lit // false
ciggie.lightIt() // ciggie.lit => true
]]>
</script>
<p>
  In practice, the difference is that now we have to instance our Cigar before
  being able to use it.
</p>
<p>
  Nothing essentially wrong with it. If you could potentially have your app running
  on more than once place at the same time in the screen, that's a good case.
