  As I explained before, we need a global object though which we can access those methods that sit 
  inside the closure.
</p>
<p>So to keep on with our previous bit:</p>
<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: js">
<![CDATA[
(function() {
  Cigar = {};
  
  function lightIt()  { console.log('=~~~~ <- cigar is lit')}
  function puff()     { console.log('@@@@@  <- smoke puffs') }
  function putOut()   { console.log('= <- no more smoke') }
  Cigar.lightIt = lightIt,
    Cigar.puff = puff,
    Cigar.putOut = putOut;
})()

typeof Cigar      // "object"
typeof Cigar.puff // "function"
Cigar.lightIt()   // "=~~~~ <- cigar is lit"
]]>
</script>
<p>
  Note that we declared <em>Cigar</em> without <em>var</em>. Javascript will chuck that in the global scope because
  of that, which is what we want.
