<h1 class="centered">First of all: scope!</h1>
<p>
  We can use some clever scoping to achieve a similar effect to what you get with
  OOP languages. You can scope things away in closures so they won't be visible everywhere.
</p>
<p>Like so:</p>
<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: js">
<![CDATA[
(function() {
  function lightIt()  { console.log('=~~~~ <- cigar is lit')}
  function puff()     { console.log('@@@@@  <- smoke puffs') }
  function putOut()   { console.log('= <- no more smoke') }
})()
typeof puff   // => "undefined"
typeof putOut // => "undefined"
]]>
</script>
<p>
  Don't be fooled though. Those methods exist, just not outside of that closure. So what we'll do
  is we'll create "gateways" to the outside world that they can use.
