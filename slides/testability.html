<h1 class="centered">How do I test it?</h1>
<p>Humm...</p>
<p>
  Some kinds of tests in Javascript are <em>hard</em> to do. If you come from Ruby,
  you won't find half of the tools and quality.
</p>
<p>
  That's because Javascript is a lot more constrained than Ruby. Sucks, but we gotta
  live with it.
</p>
<p>
  If you need to test each method, expose them through a separate object.
</p>
<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: js">
<![CDATA[
(function() {
  Cigar.private = {};
  with (Cigar) { private.lightIt = Cigar.lightIt }
)()
]]>
</script>
<p>
  Test it along with the rest of your interface (integration style) using Selenium. It's
  less fine grained since you're only testing outcomes, but does the job.
</p>
<p>
  Or test it the old fashioned way. You'll catch more problems anyways.
